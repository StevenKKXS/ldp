## Session 0

- Created task for flow-matching DP baseline experiments on square and tool_hang.
- Planned two variants: full-trajectory `horizon=10` and direct 8-step action-only flow matching.
- Resource assigned: `tingwen_ptp_4gpu_node_96h_49722d42` at `10.100.2.35:33805`.

## Session 1

- Added `FlowMatchingTransformerHybridImagePolicy` with action-space FM training target `noise - action` and fixed-step Euler sampling from noise to action.
- Added four experiment configs: square/tool_hang crossed with full `horizon=10` and direct action-only 8-step policy horizon.
- Fixed transformer workspace sampled-action MSE alignment for `pred_action_steps_only=true`.
- Local syntax check passed for the new policy and touched workspace file; full Hydra check requires the remote training env because local Python lacks hydra.
