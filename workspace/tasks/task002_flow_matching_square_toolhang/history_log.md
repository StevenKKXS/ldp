# History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=7 -->

## Session 0

- Created task for flow-matching DP baseline experiments on square and tool_hang.
- Planned two variants: full-trajectory `horizon=10` and direct 8-step action-only flow matching.
- Resource assigned: `tingwen_ptp_4gpu_node_96h_49722d42` at `10.100.2.35:33805`.

## Session 1

- Added `FlowMatchingTransformerHybridImagePolicy` with action-space FM training target `noise - action` and fixed-step Euler sampling from noise to action.
- Added four experiment configs: square/tool_hang crossed with full `horizon=10` and direct action-only 8-step policy horizon.
- Fixed transformer workspace sampled-action MSE alignment for `pred_action_steps_only=true`.
- Local syntax check passed for the new policy and touched workspace file; full Hydra check requires the remote training env because local Python lacks hydra.
- Pushed branch `intern_method_developer/task002_flow_matching_square_toolhang` at commit `3914a6b`.
- Synced the pushed worktree from CPU side to GPU node path `/mnt/nfs/tingwen/intern_method_developer/repos/ldp_flow_matching` using `tar | ssh`; avoided GPU-node external network access.
- Linked remote `data` to `/mnt/3fs2/data/tingwen.du/intern_ldp_explorer/datasets`.
- Remote `gmp-py310` py_compile passed and all four Hydra configs parsed with `--cfg job`.
- Stopped before smoke/training launch per user handoff request; no GPU training process was started by this session.

## Session 2

- User instructed not to touch the previously assigned GPU node and to switch away from this flow-matching task.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.
- Recorded handoff status locally for task continuity.

## Session 3

- User provided rules for the next PTP encoder method-development task and confirmed the previous GPU must not be touched.
- Created local documentation structure under `docs/` for global plan tracking and two candidate encoder directions.
- Added `docs/main.md`, `docs/agents.md`, `docs/status.md`, global plan, and per-direction plan/status/experiments/obs_log files.
- Marked both directions as waiting for detailed Direction A / Direction B plans before formal review.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 4

- Answered storage-location question for the new PTP encoder docs.
- Verified `docs/` is located at `/work-agents/intern_method_developer/ldp/docs` on filesystem `overlay` mounted at `/`.
- Noted this is not `/mnt/nfs/tingwen` and not `/mnt/cephfs/home/tinwen.du`; the docs are also committed and pushed to the task branch.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 5

- Saved the user-provided Direction A detailed plan as `docs/direction_a_future_action_contrastive/plan_detailed_2026-05-18.md`.
- Added review notes at `docs/direction_a_future_action_contrastive/review_2026-05-18.md`.
- Updated `docs/main.md`, `docs/status.md`, Direction A `status.md`, and Direction A `obs_log.md` to mark Direction A as reviewed but not implemented.
- Main review concerns: exact action-window alignment, condition fusion tensor shape, B2 architecture parity, diagonal masking in soft contrastive loss, action normalization, sigma choice, and frozen/finetune semantics.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 6

- Clarified that "action window" in Direction A means the action segment used as contrastive similarity supervision, not a change to PTP prediction horizon or rollout logic.
- User clarified first Direction A experiments should preserve the proven PTP structure in the robomimic 0.2.0-compatible setup as much as possible.
- Added `docs/direction_a_future_action_contrastive/review_update_ptp_compat_2026-05-18.md`.
- Updated Direction A status, obs log, global docs status, and main docs entry to favor exact-PTP-compatible encoder pretraining rather than policy-side condition concat.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 7

- Saved the user-provided Direction B detailed plan as `docs/direction_b_action_sequence_predictive/plan_detailed_2026-05-18.md`.
- Added review notes at `docs/direction_b_action_sequence_predictive/review_2026-05-18.md`.
- Updated `docs/main.md`, `docs/status.md`, Direction B `status.md`, and Direction B `obs_log.md` to mark Direction B as reviewed but not implemented.
- Main review recommendation: first-pass Direction B should preserve exact PTP policy structure and use action-sequence prediction only as encoder pretraining.
- Code observations recorded: existing PTP has `obs_encoder_dir` / `obs_encoder_freeze`, `past_action_pred=true` keeps full action trajectory loss, and the dataset returns `n_obs_steps` observations plus an action sequence of length `horizon`.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.
