# History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=8 -->

## Session 0

- Created task for flow-matching DP baseline experiments on square and tool_hang.
- Planned two variants: full-trajectory `horizon=10` and direct 8-step action-only flow matching.
- Resource assigned: `tingwen_ptp_4gpu_node_96h_49722d42` at `10.100.2.35:33805`.

## Session 1

- Added `FlowMatchingTransformerHybridImagePolicy` with action-space FM training target `noise - action` and fixed-step Euler sampling from noise to action.
- Added four experiment configs: square/tool_hang crossed with full `horizon=10` and direct action-only 8-step policy horizon.
- Fixed transformer workspace sampled-action MSE alignment for `pred_action_steps_only=true`.
- Local syntax check passed for the new policy and touched workspace file; full Hydra check requires the remote training env because local Python lacks hydra.
- Pushed branch `intern_method_developer/task002_flow_matching_square_toolhang` at commit `3914a6b`.
- Synced the pushed worktree from CPU side to GPU node path `/mnt/nfs/tingwen/intern_method_developer/repos/ldp_flow_matching` using `tar | ssh`; avoided GPU-node external network access.
- Linked remote `data` to `/mnt/3fs2/data/tingwen.du/intern_ldp_explorer/datasets`.
- Remote `gmp-py310` py_compile passed and all four Hydra configs parsed with `--cfg job`.
- Stopped before smoke/training launch per user handoff request; no GPU training process was started by this session.

## Session 2

- User instructed not to touch the previously assigned GPU node and to switch away from this flow-matching task.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.
- Recorded handoff status locally for task continuity.

## Session 3

- User provided rules for the next PTP encoder method-development task and confirmed the previous GPU must not be touched.
- Created local documentation structure under `docs/` for global plan tracking and two candidate encoder directions.
- Added `docs/main.md`, `docs/agents.md`, `docs/status.md`, global plan, and per-direction plan/status/experiments/obs_log files.
- Marked both directions as waiting for detailed Direction A / Direction B plans before formal review.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 4

- Answered storage-location question for the new PTP encoder docs.
- Verified `docs/` is located at `/work-agents/intern_method_developer/ldp/docs` on filesystem `overlay` mounted at `/`.
- Noted this is not `/mnt/nfs/tingwen` and not `/mnt/cephfs/home/tinwen.du`; the docs are also committed and pushed to the task branch.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 5

- Saved the user-provided Direction A detailed plan as `docs/direction_a_future_action_contrastive/plan_detailed_2026-05-18.md`.
- Added review notes at `docs/direction_a_future_action_contrastive/review_2026-05-18.md`.
- Updated `docs/main.md`, `docs/status.md`, Direction A `status.md`, and Direction A `obs_log.md` to mark Direction A as reviewed but not implemented.
- Main review concerns: exact action-window alignment, condition fusion tensor shape, B2 architecture parity, diagonal masking in soft contrastive loss, action normalization, sigma choice, and frozen/finetune semantics.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 6

- Clarified that "action window" in Direction A means the action segment used as contrastive similarity supervision, not a change to PTP prediction horizon or rollout logic.
- User clarified first Direction A experiments should preserve the proven PTP structure in the robomimic 0.2.0-compatible setup as much as possible.
- Added `docs/direction_a_future_action_contrastive/review_update_ptp_compat_2026-05-18.md`.
- Updated Direction A status, obs log, global docs status, and main docs entry to favor exact-PTP-compatible encoder pretraining rather than policy-side condition concat.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 7

- Saved the user-provided Direction B detailed plan as `docs/direction_b_action_sequence_predictive/plan_detailed_2026-05-18.md`.
- Added review notes at `docs/direction_b_action_sequence_predictive/review_2026-05-18.md`.
- Updated `docs/main.md`, `docs/status.md`, Direction B `status.md`, and Direction B `obs_log.md` to mark Direction B as reviewed but not implemented.
- Main review recommendation: first-pass Direction B should preserve exact PTP policy structure and use action-sequence prediction only as encoder pretraining.
- Code observations recorded: existing PTP has `obs_encoder_dir` / `obs_encoder_freeze`, `past_action_pred=true` keeps full action trajectory loss, and the dataset returns `n_obs_steps` observations plus an action sequence of length `horizon`.
- Performed no GPU, SSH, training, smoke, or remote file operation in this session.

## Session 8

- Took over PR #1 on branch `intern_method_developer/task002_flow_matching_square_toolhang` from `intern_method_developer`.
- Confirmed assigned GPU node `10.100.2.35:33805` is reachable and has 4 idle H200 GPUs.
- Fixed runtime compatibility issues found by smoke:
  - Added robomimic 0.4 fallback for `CropRandomizer`, which moved from `robomimic.models.base_nets` to `robomimic.models.obs_core`.
  - Removed stale `embedding` entries from the two square raw-image FM dataset configs.
  - Changed transformer workspace to instantiate `env_runner` only when the current training run will actually perform rollout and has rollout init states.
  - Installed missing `threadpoolctl==3.6.0` into the NFS `gmp-py310` env from the CPU/common side.
  - Linked the existing pure-Python `pytorch3d` transforms stub into the NFS `gmp-py310` env.
- Smoke command pattern used 1 epoch, 1 train step, 1 val step, sample MSE enabled, rollout disabled, batch size 2, and raw-image mode.
- Smoke passed for all four configs:
  - `square_h10`: train_loss `1.3324`, val_loss `0.9522`, train_action_mse_error `0.8067`.
  - `square_action8`: train_loss `1.3735`, val_loss `1.3963`, train_action_mse_error `0.7950`.
  - `tool_hang_h10`: train_loss `1.3295`, val_loss `0.9937`, train_action_mse_error `1.0175`.
  - `tool_hang_action8`: train_loss `1.3992`, val_loss `1.3916`, train_action_mse_error `0.7914`.
- Smoke artifacts:
  - outputs: `/mnt/nfs/tingwen/intern_method_developer/tasks/task002_flow_matching_square_toolhang/outputs/handoff_smoke_20260518_141621`
  - logs: `/mnt/nfs/tingwen/intern_method_developer/tasks/task002_flow_matching_square_toolhang/logs/handoff_smoke_20260518_141621`
- Launched four formal training jobs on the 4-GPU node:
  - `square_h10`, GPU 0, launcher pid `115480`.
  - `square_action8`, GPU 1, launcher pid `115487`.
  - `tool_hang_h10`, GPU 2, launcher pid `115494`.
  - `tool_hang_action8`, GPU 3, launcher pid `115501`.
- Formal training artifacts:
  - outputs: `/mnt/nfs/tingwen/intern_method_developer/tasks/task002_flow_matching_square_toolhang/outputs/formal_train_20260518_143331`
  - logs: `/mnt/nfs/tingwen/intern_method_developer/tasks/task002_flow_matching_square_toolhang/logs/formal_train_20260518_143331`
- Formal launch settings: default 3500 epochs and batch size 64 from the configs, `training.rollout_every=999999` to avoid online rollout until env-runner dependencies are repaired, and `checkpoint.topk.k=0` to keep only rolling `latest.ckpt` instead of accumulating top-k checkpoint files.
